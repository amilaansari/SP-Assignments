# SP-Assignments
A collection of assignments undertaken during my studies at Singapore Polytechnic

In this assignment, I was tasked to use Bootstrap to modify my redesign of an existing food delivery website (see HTML, CSS Web Design) to enhance its responsiveness.

## Javascript Web Validations
*HTML, CSS portions were provided. i.e index.html, process.html are not my design/code*

In this assignment, I was tasked to implement front-end data validation with javascript. Prior to submission, my code would check for the following. 
- Empty fields and/or if a selection was made (i.e "Halal" radio button) 
- If data input contained accurate information (i.e "Price" field containing only numbers).

If an error was present, I styled my code to highlight any errors/missing data upon submission (textbox would be in focus) to draw the users attention to them.


## Jquery Web Validations
*HTML, CSS portions were provided. i.e index.html, process.html, listitems.html are not my design/code.*

In this assignment, I was tasked to implement front-end data validation with jquery. Prior to submission, my code would check for the following.
- Empty fields and/or if a selection was made (i.e "Halal" radio button)
- If data input contained accurate information (i.e "Price" field containing only numbers, decimal points or $)

If an error was present, I styled my code to highlight any errors/missing data upon submission (textbox background would be in yellow) to draw the users attention to them.
Additionally, a counter was added to the "Description" text area to track the number of characters entered.


## Python Menu Programme
In this assignment, I was tasked to create a "menu" that would be deployed and navigated within the terminal. This was an exercise that employed classes, objects, functions, for loops, while loops, if/else statements, lists/arrays and reading files.
